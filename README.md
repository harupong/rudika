## TODO

1. Switch command-line options handling to commander

    visionmedia/commander https://github.com/visionmedia/commander

    subcommand handling seems much smarter than trollop

    I want to show all available options/subcommands, as help reference, when `rudika` is executed w/o any options/subcommands


2. Add scheduling feature
